# Signal Generator

A application for generate basically signals(Sine / Cosine), and show plots then.

Allowed select difference frequency / sample rate / amplitude for each signal.

# Road Map

* [] Cosine generator
* [] Convert signal to waveform , play it then. let us felling difference signal on ears.
* [] Add DFT / Mel plots
* [] Extra sound feature functions, like Chroma.
